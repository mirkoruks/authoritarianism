# The effect of IQ on social conservatism

This repo contains code for one of my papers on the effect of IQ on social conservatism (a) right wing authoritarianism and b) social dominance orientation). It also contains some results of me going down the rabbit hole of twin fixed effects models (some derivation of expected bias for pooled OLS, FE models with mixed zygosity as well as FE models for MZ and DZ twins separately as well as some code for power analyses). Last but not least, there are some nice DAGs of the conventional sibling comparison design (Sibling_FE.png) and then of the Twin comparison design/Twin fixed effects model (Twin_FE.png). It would be cool to include here all the tweaks discussed in the behavioral genetics literature, such as the consequences of (in-)direct assortative mating, passive gene-environment correlation, the violation of the equal environment assumption, GxE and so forth. Would be nice to see how all these phenomena affect the expected bias of Twin-FE estimate.
